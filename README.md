# MalwareBlock

## DISCLAIMER
**The present software is only a home-made project, so do not trust it blindly, as it may not catch some files that are actually malwares.
Thus, with this warning, I relieve myself of all responsibilities about any problems you may encounter.**

## NOTES
* The database (SQLite) is too big to be uploaded with the source code, so you can only find it in the release files.

## INSTALLATION
1) Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/xxyrnn/MalwareBlock/releases) page and download the latest version
2) Unzip the downloaded file in your preferred folder
3) **[OPTIONAL]** Add _MalwareBlock.exe_ to `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup` for it to start along with Windows

## USAGE
_# space for GUI screenshot and demonstration GIF_

The `Change` button lets you switch between choosing a folder or a file. If a file is chosen, after clicking on `Start`, MalwareBlock will scan it and tell if it is or is not a malware;
if, on the contrary, a folder is chosen, after clicking on `Start`, it starts monitoring that folder for new files and, when there are any, it scans them and only tells if they are **(but
not if they are not)** malwares.
The `Stop` button is only useful when a folder is being monitored, to stop MalwareBlock from monitoring it.

**N.B.:** If you minimize the window, it will actually be minimized to system tray, so that MalwareBlock can keep working in the background.

## TODO
* Add comments and credits
* Test with known malware
* Check `Scan()` function cause it gets called twice and I think it's useless
* Add event logging
